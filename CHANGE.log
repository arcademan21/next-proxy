## Test changes

- Moved the `test` folder to the package root to facilitate test execution and maintenance.
- Fixed the `NextRequest` mock so the `origin` header respects the value passed in each test, allowing correct validation of CORS logic.
- Adjusted Jest and TypeScript configuration to include the `test` folder and ensure type compatibility.
- Validated correct operation of tests for CORS, rate limiting, request/response transformation, and validation.
