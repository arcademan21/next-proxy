## Test changes

- Moved the `test` folder to the package root to facilitate test execution and maintenance.
- Fixed the `NextRequest` mock so the `origin` header respects the value passed in each test, allowing correct validation of CORS logic.
- Adjusted Jest and TypeScript configuration to include the `test` folder and ensure type compatibility.
- Validated correct operation of tests for CORS, rate limiting, request/response transformation, and validation.

--- DEV NOTES ---
1. Ensure all request and response transformations are properly typed.
2. Consider adding more detailed logging for debugging purposes.
3. Review CORS handling to support more complex scenarios.
4. Implement additional security measures as needed.
